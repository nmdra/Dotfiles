# NoteBrain CLI Skill for AI Agents

NoteBrain is a high-performance Go CLI tool that indexes an Obsidian vault into a local ChromaDB vector database. It provides semantic search, graph traversal, backlink discovery, hidden relationship finding, full note retrieval, and tag analysis across markdown notes.

## Core Execution Principles & Rationale

To operate efficiently and prevent wasted tokens or hung sessions, follow these foundational principles:

1. **NoteBrain Only — No Generic File Search**: Never use `grep`, `find`, `ls` or ad-hoc shell scripting against the vault's markdown files to answer the user's question. Treat `notebrain` as the only interface to the vault's content. If a query returns nothing useful, refine the `notebrain` query rather than falling back to a filesystem search.
2. **Non-Interactive Execution (`--format json`)**: Always specify `--format json` (or `ndjson`/`tsv`) on query commands so you receive structured, parseable data immediately without launching the interactive TUI. All examples below assume `--format json` unless noted.
3. **AI Agent Command Chaining (`--jsonpath`)**: Whenever you only need specific fields (like extracting note slugs or text to pipe into follow-up commands), use `--jsonpath` (e.g., `--jsonpath="$.results[0].note_slug"`). Scalar values output as raw strings and arrays print each item on a new line, avoiding `jq`.
4. **Retrieve Complete Notes (`notebrain get`)**: When `search` returns a relevant note chunk, use `notebrain get <note-slug-or-path>` rather than guessing chunk indices to retrieve the complete reconstructed markdown note.
5. **Retrieve Content for Synthesis (`--include-text`)**: By default, query commands return lightweight metadata envelopes. Whenever your task requires summarizing or reasoning about chunk content directly from search results, append `--include-text`.
6. **CLI Syntax Rules**: In development environments, execute `./notebrain` if `notebrain` is not in PATH. Always encapsulate note titles, tags, and queries in double quotes. Strictly use `--vault-path` and `--chroma-path` (never `--vault` or `--db`). For graph and note commands (`backlinks`, `connections`, `hidden`, `tags`, `get`), pass exactly one positional argument: `<note>`. For `boosted` search, specify `--seed=<slug>`. For resets, pipe confirmation (`echo yes | notebrain reset`).
7. **Graph & Link Filtering (`--skip-attachments`, `--skip-phantom`)**: By default, NoteBrain excludes image/attachment links (`.webp`, `.png`, `.pdf`, `.canvas`) from graph edges (`--skip-attachments=true`), and excludes uncreated "phantom" notes (wikilinks without a `.md` file on disk) from results (`--skip-phantom=true`). To explore missing notes or broken links, pass `--skip-phantom=false` (marked with `"is_phantom": true` in JSON or `[phantom]` in text).

---

## Token Budget Defaults & Session Caching

To avoid burning unnecessary tokens and latency:

- **Limit Result Sizes**: Default `--limit` to 5 (not the tool's default 10) unless the user asks for broad coverage.
- **Selective `--include-text`**: Only pass `--include-text` on the _first_ command in a retrieval workflow. For follow-up commands (`connections`, `tags`, `backlinks` used purely to map structure), omit `--include-text` — slugs, titles, and scores are enough to decide what (if anything) to `get` in full.
- **Prefer `--jsonpath`**: Extract only the fields you will actually use rather than loading full JSON envelopes into context.
- **Reuse Within a Session**: If a `backlinks`, `connections`, or `hidden` call was already run for a given seed slug earlier in this conversation, reuse those results instead of re-querying, unless the user asked to re-ingest or the vault may have changed.

## Command Selection Guide

Select the specialized command tailored to the user's analytical goal:

| User Intent                                         | Command       | Why & How to Use                                                                                                                |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "What do my notes say about X?"                     | `search`      | Performs vector similarity search across all note chunks. Use `--tag="TagName"` to filter by tag.                               |
| "Read the full content of note Y"                   | `get`         | Retrieves and reconstructs the complete note text and metadata by slug or file path.                                            |
| "What links directly to this note?"                 | `backlinks`   | Finds explicit `[[wikilink]]` references pointing to the target note.                                                           |
| "What is structurally nearby in the graph?"         | `connections` | Executes breadth-first search (BFS) over wikilinks up to `--hops N`. Keep `--hops 1` or `--hops 2` to avoid exponential blowup. |
| "What is related in meaning but NOT linked?"        | `hidden`      | Surfaces unlinked-but-semantically-similar notes. Highly valuable for discovering conceptual bridges.                           |
| "Find concepts related to X centered around note Y" | `boosted`     | Combines vector similarity with graph proximity to a `--seed` note.                                                             |
| "What notes share tags with X?"                     | `tags`        | Analyzes tag overlap. Returns clean tag strings in the `tags` array.                                                            |
| "Is the database up to date?"                       | `stats`       | Outputs collection counts (`chunks`, `links`). Supports `--format=json` and `--jsonpath`.                                       |
| "Index or re-index the vault"                       | `ingest`      | Synchronizes markdown notes into ChromaDB. Re-ingestion is idempotent.                                                          |

## Command Syntax

### Semantic Search & Tag Filtering (`search`)

```bash
notebrain search "kubernetes reconciliation" --tag="Kubernetes" --limit 5 --include-text
```

#### Key search flags

| Flag                 | Purpose                                                                                                                                            | Default |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `--top-k N`          | Maximum chunks to retain **per note**. Prevents one long note from dominating results while preserving depth.                                      | `3`     |
| `--context-window N` | Fetches ±N adjacent chunks around each match into `context`. Use for lightweight multi-result context; use `get` only when you need the full note. | `0`     |
| `--has-tasks`        | Only return chunks that contain task lists (checkboxes).                                                                                           | off     |
| `--has-code`         | Only return chunks that contain fenced code blocks.                                                                                                | off     |
| `--section`          | Filter results to chunks under a specific heading path (e.g., `"Architecture > Components"`).                                                      | —       |
| `--limit N`          | Maximum total results to return.                                                                                                                   | `10`    |
| `--tag "TagName"`    | Filter or search by tag name.                                                                                                                      | —       |
| `--min-score F`      | Suppress results below this similarity score (0–1).                                                                                                | `0.4`   |

### Complete Note Retrieval (`get`)

```bash
notebrain get "02areaskubernetesckadkubernetes-native-applications"
```

### Graph Connections, Hidden Links & Tags (`connections`, `hidden`, `tags`, `backlinks`)

All graph and tag commands accept **exactly one positional argument**: the target note slug.

```bash
# Find explicit backlinks pointing to a note
notebrain backlinks "kubernetes-architecture" --include-text

# Traverse wikilink graph connections up to N hops
notebrain connections "kubernetes-architecture" --hops 2

# Find notes sharing common tags with the target note
notebrain tags "kubernetes-architecture" --min-shared 1

# Discover unlinked but semantically similar notes
notebrain hidden "kubernetes-architecture" --limit 5 --include-text
```

#### Graph & Link Filtering Flags

| Flag                 | Purpose                                                                                               | Default |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `--skip-attachments` | Exclude attachment and image links (e.g., `.webp`, `.png`, `.canvas`) from graph edges and backlinks. | `true`  |
| `--skip-phantom`     | Exclude uncreated notes (phantom wikilinks without a markdown file on disk) from results.             | `true`  |

### Graph-Boosted Search (`boosted`)

```bash
notebrain boosted --seed="kubernetes-architecture" "control plane components" --boost 1.5
```

## JSON Output Schema

Every query command wraps results in a JSON envelope. Understanding the field specification is essential for reliable extraction:

| Field          | Present When                    | Description                                                                                |
| -------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `note_slug`    | Always                          | URL-safe identifier derived from the file path.                                            |
| `title`        | Always                          | Note title from frontmatter or filename.                                                   |
| `file_path`    | Always                          | Relative path within the vault.                                                            |
| `score`        | Always                          | Similarity score (0–1) for search; hop count for connections.                              |
| `chunk_index`  | Search, hidden, boosted         | Which chunk of the note matched (0-indexed).                                               |
| `tags`         | When note has tags              | Array of tag strings.                                                                      |
| `heading_path` | When chunk is under a heading   | Breadcrumb path like `"Section > Subsection"`.                                             |
| `text`         | When `--include-text` is passed | The matched chunk's full markdown text, with code blocks preserved.                        |
| `context`      | When `--context-window N` > 0   | Array of ±N adjacent chunk texts, ordered by chunk index.                                  |
| `extra`        | Connections, tags, boosted      | Command-specific info (e.g., `"2 hop(s)"`, `"graph-boosted"`).                             |
| `is_phantom`   | When `--skip-phantom=false`     | Boolean (`true`) if the note is an uncreated phantom link without a markdown file on disk. |

## Retrieval Workflow (Tiered, Not Automatic)

To prevent excessive tool calls and context bloat, follow a progressive, conditional retrieval strategy:

1. **Start Lean**: Always start with `search --context-window 1 --top-k 2 --include-text --limit 5`.
2. **Check Score & Sufficiency**: Check the top result's `score`. If `score ≥ 0.75` and the returned context fully answers the question, **stop here** — do not run further commands.
3. **Escalate Conditionally**: Only escalate if the question or initial findings require it:
   - Ask is about **connections/related notes** → also run `connections --hops 2` (no `--include-text`; slugs/titles are enough for a graph map).
   - Ask is about **what links here** → run `backlinks` instead of the full chain.
   - Ask is **exploratory** ("what do I know about X") and step 1 was thin or low-score (`score < 0.75`) → run `hidden` too.
4. **Avoid Blanket Chaining**: Never run all four commands (`search → backlinks → connections → hidden`) unless the user explicitly asks for a full comprehensive map of the topic across the entire vault.

### Targeted Retrieval Patterns

```bash
# Extract top slug directly via JSONPath
SLUG=$(notebrain search "message broker backpressure" --limit 3 --top-k 2 \
  --context-window 1 --include-text --jsonpath="$.results[0].note_slug")

# Fetch complete note text for a specific hit
notebrain get "$SLUG" --jsonpath="$.text"

# Find code examples about a topic
notebrain search "docker compose networking" --has-code --include-text

# Find actionable tasks related to a project
notebrain search "sprint planning" --has-tasks --include-text
```

---

## Configuration Hierarchy

NoteBrain resolves settings in priority order:

1. CLI command flags (`--vault-path`, `--vault-name`, `--chroma-path`, `--top-k`, `--context-window`)
2. Configuration file (`~/.notebrain/config/config.toml` or specified via `--config`)
